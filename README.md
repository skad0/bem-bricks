# bem-bricks

Some additional BEM blocks to use with [bem-components](https://github.com/bem/bem-components).

## Blocks

* `info-modal` — wrapper around [modal](https://en.bem.info/platform/libs/bem-components/5.0.0/desktop/modal/) to reuse same instance many times.
* `modal_has-close` — modifier to add closing cross to `modal`.
